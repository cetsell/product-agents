# Dunning Playbook

Involuntary churn recovery in full: the dunning stack, pre-dunning prevention, retry logic by decline type, the dunning email sequence, and recovery benchmarks. Full email copy for the sequence is drafted with `/email-sequence` (see its `references/billing-and-winback-emails.md`).

## The Dunning Stack

```
Pre-dunning → Smart retry → Dunning emails → Grace period → Hard cancel
```

## Pre-Dunning (Prevent Failures)

- **Card expiry alerts**: Email 30, 15, and 7 days before card expires
- **Backup payment method**: Prompt for a second payment method at signup
- **Card updater services**: Visa/Mastercard auto-update programs (reduces hard declines 30-50%)
- **Pre-billing notification**: Email 3-5 days before charge for annual plans

## Smart Retry Logic

Not all failures are the same. Retry strategy by decline type:

| Decline Type | Examples | Retry Strategy |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Soft decline (temporary) | Insufficient funds, processor timeout | Retry 3-5 times over 7-10 days |
| Hard decline (permanent) | Card stolen, account closed | Don't retry — ask for new card |
| Authentication required | 3D Secure, SCA | Send customer to update payment |

**Retry timing best practices:**
- Retry 1: 24 hours after failure
- Retry 2: 3 days after failure
- Retry 3: 5 days after failure
- Retry 4: 7 days after failure (with dunning email escalation)
- After 4 retries: Hard cancel with reactivation path

**Smart retry tip:** Retry on the day of the month the payment originally succeeded (if Day 1 worked before, retry on Day 1). Stripe Smart Retries handles this automatically.

## Dunning Email Sequence

| Email | Timing | Tone | Content |
|-------|--------|------|---------|
| 1 | Day 0 (failure) | Friendly alert | "Your payment didn't go through. Update your card." |
| 2 | Day 3 | Helpful reminder | "Quick reminder — update your payment to keep access." |
| 3 | Day 7 | Urgency | "Your account will be paused in 3 days. Update now." |
| 4 | Day 10 | Final warning | "Last chance to keep your account active." |

**Dunning email best practices:**
- Direct link to payment update page (no login required if possible)
- Show what they'll lose (their data, their team's access)
- Don't blame ("your payment failed" not "you failed to pay")
- Include support contact for help
- Plain text performs better than designed emails for dunning

## Recovery Benchmarks

| Metric | Poor | Average | Good |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| Soft decline recovery | <40% | 50-60% | 70%+ |
| Hard decline recovery | <10% | 20-30% | 40%+ |
| Overall payment recovery | <30% | 40-50% | 60%+ |
| Pre-dunning prevention | None | 10-15% | 20-30% |
